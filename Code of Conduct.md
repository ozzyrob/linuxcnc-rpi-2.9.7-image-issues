# Code of Conduct


## Blackfella/Whitefella
### Song by Warumpi Band ‧ 1985

Black fella, white fella  
It doesn't matter what your colour  
As long as you a true fella  
As long as you a real fella  
All the people of different races  
With different lives, in different places  
It doesn't matter what your name is  
We got to have lots of changes  
We need more brothers, if we're to make it  
We need more sisters, if we're to save it  
Are you the one who's gonna stand up and be counted?  
Are you the one who's gonna be there when we shout it?  
Are you the one who's always ready with a helping hand?  
Are you the one who understands these family plans?  
Black fella, white fella  
Yellow fella, any fella  
It doesn't matter what your colour  
As long as you a true fellow  
All the people of different races  
With different lives, in different places  
It doesn't matter which religions  
It's all the same when the ship is sinking  
We need more brothers, if we're to make it  
We need more sisters, if we're to save it  
Are you the one who's gonna stand up and be counted?  
Are you the one who's gonna be there when we shout it?  
Are you the one who's always ready with a helping hand?  
Are you the one who understands these family plans?  
Stand up, stand up and be counted  
Stand up, stand up and be counted  
Are you the one who's always ready with a helping hand?  
Are you the one who understands these family plans?  
Are you the one who's always ready with a helping hand?
